# Multi-Agent-Systems


This repo aims to illustrate concepts behind Multi-agent systems through 2 projects.


Multi-agent systems (MAS) are widely used nowadays, especially for complex applications requiring interaction between several entities. More precisely, they are used in applications where it is necessary to solve problems in a distributed way (data processing) or to design distributed systems respecting a certain level of autonomy of the entities which compose them (process control). This is the case, for example, for negotiation agents, drones, or energy distribution systems in a "smart grid".
